# Particles2PDEs

Source code for "Particles to PDEs Parsimoniously" by Arbabi & Kevrekidis 2020

Using first prinicples leads to microscopic evolution laws for physical, chemical and biological systems (e.g. lattice dynamics in crystals, molecular interaction in reactions or neuron response in tissue). Yet some of these systems may also admit coarse-grained evolution laws, e.g. in the form of PDEs, which can lead to huge savings in computation. We propose a frameowrk for 1) identifying the coarse-grained variable from data and 2) finding the PDE that governs that variable evolution. The example we use is a system-of-agent motion that leads to the Burgers PDE at the coarse-level description.
