# Particles2PDEs
Coarse-graining particle simulations


Given a particle- or agent-based model of the system, this framework comes up with a macro-scale PDE that describes large-scale evolution. 
First, we identify the appropriate macro-scale PDE variable using manifold learning in the space of distributions, and then use shallow neural nets to lesarn the PDE governing that variable.
